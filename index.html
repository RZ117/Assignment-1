<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello there! My name is Reza Syahputra Koto, nickname Reza. I was born in Indonesia on the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, 2003. Im just a socially awkward human that likes reading mangas, playing video games, and highly interested in technology but somehow struggles at math. I'm currently studying at RMIT University (Student No. 3940230). I can speak Indonesian &amp; English fluently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote this short introduction for my first assignment on the Introduction to Information Technology Course. I hope this can show you a little bit about me.</p>
<br>
<h2> Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;Ever since i pooped in grade school, I was always interested in technology, particularly phones &amp; computers, I started tinkering with personal computers in middle school and watched a lot of technology related videos on YouTube. Eventually I started looking forward to events and product launch keynotes (e.g. CES/MWC/Computex) and watch their livestreams, I liked watching new mobile phone and processor launches in particular. I often build computers for myself or for my dad&rsquo;s small office. I also learned how to make some sites with WordPress CMS &amp; host it on VPS services with linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At first I never thought I would have gotten into RMIT, I was recommended by my parents and agents to study here, I noticed RMIT puts a lot of emphasis on practical works, I do feel that this will help people gain real experiences for future careers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I expected to learn web programming and IT systems administration during my study at RMIT, I&rsquo;m interested in jobs in those fields in particular, I also expect to learn basic programming and network management.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Job</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is currently ideal job, an entry-level IT hardware tech support. I expect the job to include giving technical hardware and software support to customers and employees, troubleshooting, creating basic guidelines and procedures, and resolve IT related problems or incidents in a timely manner. This position is appealing to me because I have interests in computer hardware, operating system, and softwares. I also want to learn more about the workflow and attitude required in this position. I would also like to experience working in a team, working with inexperienced customers, and learn how to handle high workloads that&rsquo;s expected in this position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently studying for the Bachelor of IT degree at RMIT, I&rsquo;m quite knowledgeable with computer hardware, and how to do the initial configurations of the systems, I&rsquo;m also interested and currently learning about management softwares and Microsoft programs. I have a decent troubleshooting skills and can handle resolving problems remotely or on site with experienced or inexperienced customers and users.</p>
<p>To further enhance and to add to my skills and qualifications I plan to study at the university and self-study and research about IT support and services, along with in-depth study/research of the computer hardware, IT management softwares, Microsoft programs and the best way to deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot these systems. Currently I&rsquo;m actively maintaining some office systems remotely in my home country. I may also apply for extra online courses on various websites like YouTube, etc.</p>

<p>Big Five Personality Test: <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2,3.7,3.3,2.9,3.3#_I">https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2,3.7,3.3,2.9,3.3#_I</a></p>

<p>&nbsp; A short summary of my myers-briggs test shows that my strengths include optimism, energetic, creative, practical, rational and spontaneous, knows how to prioritize something, relaxed, and great in a crisis. While weaknesses include stubbornness, insensitive, private and reserved, easily bored, dislikes long term commitments, and risky behaviour. My online learning tests show that I&rsquo;m more of a visual learner,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I think this test gives me an insight of my general personality and overall learning style, &nbsp;while not 100% accurate, can provide me with some reference to better myself in the future, optimize my learning methods and resources, and helps me to adjust in tasks, relationships, and work environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp; In taking the results to account in forming a team, I might consider choosing teammates that will be suitable for me or complement my strengths and also teammates that supplement my weaknesses. Hopefully we can make a great team and do great in whatever projects we may be working on.</p>
