<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello there! My name is Reza Syahputra Koto, nickname Reza. I was born in Indonesia on the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, 2003. Im just a socially awkward human that likes reading mangas, playing video games, and highly interested in technology but somehow struggles at math. I'm currently studying at RMIT University (Student No. 3940230). I can speak Indonesian &amp; English fluently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote this short introduction for my first assignment on the Introduction to Information Technology Course. I hope this can show you a little bit about me.</p>
<br>
<h2> Interest in IT<h2>
  <p>Ever since i was in grade school, I was always interested in technology, particularly phones &amp; computers, I started tinkering with personal computers in middle school and watched a lot of technology related videos on YouTube. Eventually I started looking forward to events and product launch keynotes (e.g. CES/MWC/Computex) and watch their livestreams, I liked watching new mobile phone and processor launches in particular. I often build computers for myself or for my dad&rsquo;s small office. I also learned how to make some sites with WordPress CMS &amp; host it on VPS services with linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At first I never thought I would have gotten into RMIT, I was recommended by my parents and agents to study here, I noticed RMIT puts a lot of emphasis on practical works, I do feel that this will help people gain real experiences for future careers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I expected to learn web programming and IT systems administration during my study at RMIT, I&rsquo;m interested in jobs in those fields in particular, I also expect to learn basic programming and network management.</p>
