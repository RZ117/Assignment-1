  <p> Hello there! My name is Reza Syahputra Koto, nickname Reza. I was born in Indonesia in the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, 2003. I'm just a socially awkward human that likes reading mangas, playing video games, and highly interested in technology but somehow struggles at math. I'm currently studying at RMIT University (Student No. 3940230). I can speak Indonesian &amp; English fluently.</p>
  <p> I wrote this short introduction for my first assignment on the Introduction to Information Technology Course. I hope this can show you a little bit about me.</p>
